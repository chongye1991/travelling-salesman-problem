The source code for this project contains 4 parts:
1.	Main function to parse the input arguments and run the corresponding algorithm with parameters.
2.	Algorithm classes that handles and processes each algorithm individually.
3.	Miscellaneous classes to be used by the algorithms.
4.	File I/O class to handle the input and output files.
